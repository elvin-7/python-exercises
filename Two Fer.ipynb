    "# Introduction\n",
    "In some English accents, when you say \"two for\" quickly, it sounds like \"two fer\". Two-for-one is a way of saying that if you buy one, you also get one for free. So the phrase \"two-fer\" often implies a two-for-one offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a bakery that has a holiday offer where you can buy two cookies for the price of one (\"two-fer one!\"). You take the offer and (very generously) decide to give the extra cookie to someone else in the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "Your task is to determine what you will say as you give away the extra cookie.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know the person's name (e.g. if they're named Do-yun), then you will say:\n",
    "\n",
    "One for Do-yun, one for me.\n",
    "If you don't know the person's name, you will say you instead.\n",
    "\n",
